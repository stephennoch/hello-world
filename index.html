		<h1>Stephen Noch</h1>
		<p>Hi! I'm great at making friends, making money, and helping friends make money. So let's be friends! I have experience working in B2B, B2C, and team leadership roles in SMBs (from 5 to 150 employees). I know MS Office products like the back of my hand, I'm also well-versed in Salesforce.com, LinkedIn Recruiter, Sales, Communication, Leadership, and Organizational Development. I hold a B.A. and I'm working on an M.A., but we don't care about that, do we? What matters is that I'm smart, I'm fast, I work hard, and I'm ready to make an impact. So let's do this.</p>
